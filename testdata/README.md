Test data
=========

Please create a subdirectory for each task using task code name (for example,
"portals"). Use the following convention for test files:

    task.0-01.in
    task.0-01.sol
    task.0-02.in
    task.0-02.sol
    task.1-01.in
    task.1-01.sol
    task.1-02.in
    task.1-02.sol
    task.2-01.in
    task.2-01.sol
    ...

The first number in "1-1" is the number of subtask, and the second number is the
number for the test within subtask. Use subtask 0 for example tests that are
provided in the task statement.
