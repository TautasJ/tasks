Solutions
=========

Please create a subdirectory for each task using task code name (for example,
"portals"). Prefix source code files with task code name, and select suffix that
is descriptive to the solution (for example, "portals-bfs.cpp").

Each solution file should start with a comment that briefly explains the
solution. For example:

    /**
     * Official solution for task PORTALS.
     *
     * Performs breadth-first search over all possible ...
     *
     * Author: Example Author
     */
