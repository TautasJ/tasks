\begin{document}

    Given two positive integers, find all integers that are strictly
    between them.

    \Input
    Input consists of a single line that contains two positive
    integers $A$ and $B$.

    \Output
    The first line of output should consist of a single integer ---
    the number of integers that are strictly between $A$ and $B$.
    If there is at least one such integer, then all of them should
    be listed in increasing order in the second line of output.
    
    \Examples

    \simpleexample
    {
        8 14
    }
    {
        5 \newline
        9 10 11 12 13
    }

    \simpleexample
    {
        1 2
    }
    {
        0
    }

    \Scoring

        Your submission will score full points for a subtask if it
        produces correct output for each testcase in 
        that subtask. Otherwise, if it produces correct first
        line of output for each testcase, it will score $50\%$ of the
        points for the subtask. In all other events it will score no
        points for the subtask.
        Note that no points will be awarded for a subtask if
        (in particular) time
        limit is exceeded or a runtime error is encountered in at
        least one testcase in that subtask.

    \begin{description}

        \item[Subtask 1 (30 points):] $1 \le A, B \le 1000$. 
        \item[Subtask 2 (70 points):] $1 \le A, B \le 10^{15}$,
            $A$ and $B$ differ by at most $100\,000$.

        \item[Time limit:] 1 s.
        \item[Memory limit:] 64 MB.
